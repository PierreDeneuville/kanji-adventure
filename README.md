# ü•∑ Kanji's Adventure

A tribute to Motion Twin's adventure game. In this roguelike dungeon crawler, a brave ninja (Kanji) explores procedurally generated dungeons, fights monsters, and collects treasures. Written entirely in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this game demonstrates how to create an engaging gaming experience using just web technologies.

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Architecture

- **CSS Grid**: Used for dungeon layout
- **Event-based**: Keyboard input handling for player control

### Key Features
- **Procedural Generation**: Custom algorithm for dungeon creation
- **Rarity System**: Weighted random selection for monsters and items
- **Collision Detection**: Grid-based movement and interaction system
- **Combat System**: Turn-based combat with damage calculations
- **State Management**: Game state handled through JavaScript objects

### Dungeon Generation
```javascript
// Example of room generation parameters
const BOARD_SIZE = 15;
const ROOM_SIZE = 5;
const minRoomSize = 3;
const maxRoomSize = 6;
```

The dungeon is generated using:
1. Room placement with variable sizes
2. Corridor generation between rooms
3. Entity placement (monsters, items, stairs)
4. Validation to ensure all areas are accessible

### Rarity System
```javascript
const RARITY_WEIGHTS = {
    common: 50,
    uncommon: 30,
    rare: 15,
    very_rare: 4,
    legendary: 1
};
```
